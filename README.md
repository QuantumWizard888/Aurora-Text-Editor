Minimalistic text editor created with Python and Tkinter. If you need to write simple TXT files so this is what you need. No more, no less.

## === Features ===

## === Why? ===
Consider this program as a lesson for those who want to write their own text editor using Python and Tkinter. For that matter I tried to make the code as simple as possible. Enjoy!
